        The expansion of bank loans has consistently outpaced the expansion of bank deposits by a wide margin. Low base effect, small ticket size loans, higher working capital requirements due to elevated inflation, and a shift to bank borrowings on account of strong rates in the capital market have all contributed to the recent acceleration in credit growth. According to the Reserve Bank of India, bank credit has increased by more than 14% annually.
